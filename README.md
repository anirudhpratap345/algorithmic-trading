Created three projects named Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, Quantitative Momentum Strategy and Quantitative Value Strategy

1. Equal-Weight S&amp;P 500 Index Fund: The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management.
It will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

2. Quantitative Momentum Strategy: I built an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, we calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.

3. Quantitative Value Strategy: Then in this one I built an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. From there, we calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
